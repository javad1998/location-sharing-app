# 📍 Location Sharing App

A simple Flutter-based mobile app for sharing and displaying location data on a map using [flutter_map](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map). This project is currently in development and will evolve into a more complete idea.

## 🚀 Features (So far)
- Get current user location
- Send location to server (PHP backend)
- Display markers on map
- Fetch and show other users' locations (basic version)
  
## 🎯 Goals
This project started as a portfolio piece to demonstrate mobile development skills using Flutter, HTTP requests, server communication, and interactive map UI. It may grow into a complete user-to-user location sharing platform.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Flutter
- Dart
- flutter_map
- PHP (backend)
- HTTP package

## 📌 Note
The backend is currently local (e.g., `192.168.x.x`). For production, it will be moved to a proper hosting or cloud environment.

> ✅ **To be updated with more features and a main idea soon!**
